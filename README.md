# Geometric Brownian Motion & Monte Carlo for Stock Simulation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** simulations to model stock price behaviour under stochastic processes, along with **Monte Carlo** methods for risk analysis and visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **`GBM & Monte Carlo.ipynb`** â€“ The main notebook with code, explanations and visualisations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Simulate stock and portfolio price paths under **stochastic market conditions**.
- Quantify **risk metrics** such as Value at Risk (VaR) and probability of loss.
- Analyse **distribution characteristics** of simulated final prices.
- Model **correlated asset movements** within a portfolio using Cholesky decomposition.
- Provide **visual insights** into potential market outcomes through plotted simulations.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- **Single Asset Simulation** â€“ GBM path generation for individual stocks.
- **Portfolio Simulation** â€“ Incorporates correlations to simulate multiple assets.
- **Risk Analysis** â€“ Calculates VaR, expected returns and downside probabilities.
- **Visualisation** â€“ Plots of simulated paths and histograms of final prices.
